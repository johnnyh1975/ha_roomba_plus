## When to choose

**Choose Roomba+ if:**
- You want to see a live map of where your robot is cleaning
- You want to clean specific rooms — by name, from automations or the UI
- You want automations that actually work: start only when everyone's away, pause when a door opens, clean again when it's dirtier than usual
- You want maintenance reminders for filter, brush, and battery
- You want the integration to keep working regardless of cloud availability or API changes
- You have an older 900-series robot and want automatic room detection without cloud

**Choose HA Core if:**
- You want the simplest possible setup — installed in two minutes, no extras
- Start, stop, and check battery is all you need
- You're already using it and it meets your needs — there's no reason to switch

**Choose roomba_rest980 if:**
- You want a persistent view of your floor plan with room boundaries, no-go zones, and obstacles
- You already have it running and it works for you
- ⚠️ Requires a Docker container running 24/7, cloud credentials, and a Smart Map capable robot (i/s/j-series only)

## Notes

**¹ Roomba+ map approach** renders entirely in-process using the local MQTT `pose` stream with no external container. From v2.7.0, robots on lewis firmware (i7+/i8+ on 22.x) that do not broadcast local pose data are now bootstrapped automatically from cloud traversal events.  It stopped working on firmware 3.20+ for robots where iRobot removed local `pose` reporting entirely. For robots on older firmware the live cleaning path renders accurately and persists across HA restarts via `hass.storage`. Smart Map robots gain UMF room polygon overlays from v2.3+.

**² roomba_rest980 controls:** Cleaning passes are exposed as a staging `CleanRoomPasses` Select entity — one per room and one per zone. Selecting "One Pass" or "Two Passes" stages the value locally but does NOT send a command to the robot; cleaning only begins when the user presses Start. Edge cleaning, always finish, and carpet boost have no HA entity at all — REST API only.

**³ roomba_rest980 map approach** fetches the iRobot cloud UMF floor plan and renders it as a static `CameraEntity` using Python/Pillow. The map shows the stored floor plan — not the live cleaning path. Keep-out zones and robot-learned obstacle zones are overlaid on the floor plan. Cloud credentials and a trained Smart Map are required. Supports `calibration` and `rooms` attributes for xiaomi-vacuum-map-card.

**⁴ ha-rest980** (jeremywillans/ha-rest980) is a separate project from roomba_rest980. It used the rest980 Node.js container as middleware to provide a live cleaning path, but has been broken since firmware 3.20+ removed local `pose` reporting.

**⁵ iRobot / Picea Robotics cloud** — iRobot was acquired by Picea Robotics in January 2026. Both Roomba+ and roomba_rest980 use the same Gigya→AWS Cognito authentication flow against iRobot's API endpoints.
